        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Line a large baking tray with baking paper.</li>
            <li>Combine the melted butter, brown sugar and ground cinnamon in a bowl and mix well.</li>
            <li>Lay out the cold puff pastry sheet on a clean surface</li>
            <li>With the long side closest to you, pour the cinnamon butter filling over the bottom half of the pastry. Spread from edge to edge, leaving the top half and a 1cm border closest to you bare.</li>
            <li>Fold the top half of the pastry down, towards you, over the top so the filling is now inside the pastry.</li>
            <li>Use the tines of a fork to seal the long edge closest to you.</li>
            <li>Cut the pastry into strips, about 1 Â½ cm wide.</li>
            <li>Holding the two ends, twist the pastry 4 times and place it onto the lined baking try.</li>
            <li>Chill the pastries in the freezer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200C</li>
            <li>Remove the pastries from the freezer and brush with egg wash.</li>
            <li>Place pastries in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Let the pastries cool and then dust with cinnamon sugar.</li>
        </ol>
