        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This Rosemary Garlic Bread is a great starting recipe for aspiring bakers, requiring no kneading.</p>
        <p>Instead, you just need a quick stir, an overnight proof, and then in just one hour, you'll have a perfectly puffed, round, golden-brown loaf of homemade bread.</p>
        <p>Best served with thick slices, slathered in butter, alongside a hearty soup.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups - All-purpose Flour</li>
            <li>2 tsps - Fine Sea Salt</li>
            <li>1 tbsp - Active Dry Yeast</li>
            <li>3 tbsps - Fresh Rosemary, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves - Fresh Garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1.5 cups - Warm Water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and yeast. Pour in warm water and add rosemary and garlic. Use a wooden spoon to stir just until a shaggy dough forms. Be sure to mix until the garlic and rosemary are distributed throughout. The mixture will be wet and very sticky to the touch.</li>
            <li>Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for 8 to 18 hours until dough rises, bubbles and flattens on top.</li>
            <li>Once dough is proofed, heat oven to 230Â°C. When preheated, place a 6 quart Dutch oven (with cover) in the oven for 30 minutes before baking.</li>
            <li>Dust the top of the dough with more flour, and working quickly with floured hands, fold two sides in towards the center then flip over. Re-flour hands and gently shape the dough into a ball by rotating it with both hands and pulling it under itself.</li>
            <li>Re-flour hands and scoop up the dough, placing it on a piece of parchment paper. Sprinkle the top of the dough lightly with flour and cover with a sheet of plastic wrap, then let rest 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove Dutch oven from oven. Uncover dough and carefully transfer to Dutch oven, with parchment paper beneath. Cover Dutch oven and return to oven.</li>
            <li>Bake bread 45 minutes covered, then another 10 to 15 minutes uncovered, until dough is baked through and golden brown on top. Let cool before slicing.</li>
